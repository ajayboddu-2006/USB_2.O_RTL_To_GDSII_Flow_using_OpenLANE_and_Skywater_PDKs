# RTL-to-GDSII Flow for High-Speed USB 2.0 Device

## Introduction
This document outlines the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow implemented for a **High-Speed USB 2.0 device**. The project demonstrates how open-source tools, primarily **OpenLANE**, can be used to implement a structured ASIC design flow, covering all stages from RTL design to the final GDSII layout.

## Objectives
- To implement the ASIC design flow for a **High-Speed USB 2.0 device** while adhering to USB 2.0 specifications.
- To demonstrate each step of the flow, including **synthesis**, **floorplanning**, **placement**, **routing**, and **signoff**.
- To showcase the integration of open-source tools like **OpenLANE**, **Yosys**, **Magic**, and **KLayout** into a comprehensive design pipeline.
